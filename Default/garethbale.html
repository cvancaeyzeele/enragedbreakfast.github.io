				If he has a few hours to kill, Gareth Bale loves nothing better than to recline on his sofa and switch on a Premier League game. And because most English football happens during the day and most Spanish football happens at night, he gets to watch a fair amount. Leicester and West Ham have caught his eye so far this season. He vaguely recalls a young Harry Kane joining in a few training sessions at Tottenham, but like everyone else has been astonished by his rise, and hopes he can power his old club back into the Champions League.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bale left the Premier League for La Liga in 2013, since when the fortunes of the two leagues have diverged significantly. While Spain has provided three of the last four Champions League finalists and six of the last 10 Europa League winners, England could not muster a single quarter-finalist in either competition last season. Barcelona may have taken the spoils in El Clasico at the weekend, but the talent on both sides was of a scale no Premier League game could hope to emulate.
			</p>
			<p>
				It seems an appropriate moment, then, to ask Bale what he makes of the situation. Sitting in one of the lavish presidential suites at the Bernabeu, Bale could scarcely be further away from the Chigwell training ground where he first turned up at Tottenham, or the bumpy Cardiff pitches where he played as a kid. The 4-0 defeat to Barcelona, which took place after our interview, may have been a crushing blow to Real's season. But generally Bale is enjoying his football, enjoying life in Spain. And with another week of European football upon us, he allows his thoughts to drift homewards, to the travails of the country he left.

				"For me, English teams shouldn't really be in danger," he says. It's a difficult one to put your finger on. There's a number of reasons. My personal opinion is that the league is so hard. Every team fights until the 90th minute. Over the course of 38 games, that takes a lot out of the English teams. If we play a lesser team here, if it's 4-0 at half-time, in the second half you don't have to really graft. At the end of the season we definitely feel fresher."
			</p>
			<p>
				Chelsea's struggles this season testify to the fact that it is easier being a big fish in the La Liga pond, where the quality is arguably higher but genuine shocks are rarer. "You could say Spain is the best league, but the Premier League is probably the most competitive," Bale says. "Bottom could beat top any week."
