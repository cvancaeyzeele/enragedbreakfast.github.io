				Pep Guardiola has not named the same team for two straight games in 97 matches in all competitions at Bayern Munich and the manager insists it is because he wants to give all of his players game time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The manager, speaking ahead of Bayern Munich's Champions League clash against Olympiacos on Tuesday, believes rotation keeps his squad energetic and focused. The 44-year-old did acknowledge, however, that he has regular starters who he relies upon. 
			</p>
			<p>
				'For harmony, fitness and mind, rotation is the best solution,' Guardiola said at a press conference on Monday. 'I like it when all of the players are getting a game. But, of course, there are players who are on the pitch longer than others. I don't have the time to explain (to) every player every week why he does not play. If somebody does not play, this does not mean I do not love him. And the players know that.'
