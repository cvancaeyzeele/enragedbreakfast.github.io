				FIFA's ethics committee are seeking to impose a lifetime ban on UEFA president Michel Platini, according to the lawyer of the 60-year-old Frenchman.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hans-Joachim Eckert, the German judge who chairs the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's ethics committee, has opened formal proceedings against both Platini and FIFA president Sepp Blatter after receiving the final report of an investigation into alleged serious breaches of their ethical code regarding a &pound;1.3m payment made to the UEFA chief by Blatter in 2011.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, Platini's lawyer Thibaut d'Ales has told Associated Press that the maximum sanction was recommended in the form of a lifetime ban for the former France international footballer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both face lengthy bans if they are found guilty, with a decision believed to be made in December over their futures with FIFA. Platini hopes to succeed Blatter when the next FIFA president is elected on 26 February 2016, but any ban will rule his application invalid and he wonâ€™t be allowed to run for the presidency.
